//Linked List-->

//Q1)What is linked list?
//1)Array is contiguous and we cannot change it's size once it is declared(array is stored in heap memory).

//2)In linked list it can be anywhere so it has non-contiguous memory allocation.

//3)Linked-list can increase or decrease it's size.


//Q2)Where linked list is used?
//1)In terms of DS it is used in implementing Stack and Queue as they both have not fixed size and they can increase or decrease.

//2)In terms of real-life it is used in browser when we search something over a single tab it maintains the sequence of our seacrh.


//Q3)Using struct or class to implement linked list as we need to declare our own datatype.
//1)Go to ./2linkedList.cpp file.


//Q4)Memory space used?
//1)It depends on the architecture of Computer because address size depends over it.
