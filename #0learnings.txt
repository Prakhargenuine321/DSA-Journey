#1) According to the C++ standard, main() must return an integer type (int) , otherwise it will give an error!
#2) Taking out the exponential value of an number: pow(num , power);
#3) While problem solving always remember that if numbers are given as -ive also and you want take minimum number then use "INT_MIN".

#4)When we convert 'binary' to 'decimal' then, har baar 'pow(2, index)' use karne ki jagah evaluate it in reverse order by maintaining,
   a variable jo sirf track rakhega ki current index par 'pow(2, index)' ki value hogi so it will save time by avoiding 
   'call' again and again.

#5)'long long' is 64-bit, 'int' is 32-bit.

#6)'XOR' operator--> a)if number of 1's are odd then '1'. 
                     b)if number of 1's are even then '0'.

#7)'shift' operator--> a)'>>' right-shift operator->Moves bit 'k' bits right 'num >> k' behind the scene maths is 'num/2^k'.
                       b)'<<' left-shift operatot->Movies 'k' bits left 'num << k' behind the scene maths is 'num*2^k'.

#8)'not(~)' operator--> a)if number is poistive -->1)flip it's bits. 
                                                   2)check if number is -ive(by seeing MSB)-if -ive then find 2's complement
                                                    and then store else store as it is.

                        b)if number is negative -->1)first find 2's complement of that negative number.
                                                   2)flip it's bits. 
                                                   3)check if number is -ive(by seeing MSB)-if -ive then find 2's complement 
                                                   and then store else store as it is.   

#9)In question type-"set/unset" rightmost unset/set bit, you need to go through following approach:-
   a)for 'unset' to 'set'-->do (n) | (n+1).
   a)for 'set' to 'unset'-->do (n) & (n+1).

#10)In question "Count total set bits" we need to apply->"Brian Kernighanâ€™s Algorithm":- do (n & (n-1)) each time 'count++' till 'n > 0'.
   >>Problem Link-->https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/count-total-set-bits-1587115620/1
   >>but brian kerninghan's algorithm will also be not as better as you have been submitted so go through link
     and see submission for revision.

#11)In "Conversion of Infix to Postfix" we need to remember that operator at top of stack is popped in only 2 conditions:
   >>If current element is ')' then pop untill '(' is occured ya phir jab tak stack empty na ho jaye.
   >>If priority of current operator is greater than priority of operator at top of stack.
